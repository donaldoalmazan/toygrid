tell me about toygrid

Toygrid is a proof-of-concept (PoC) microfrontend project that
demonstrates a collaborative editor. It is based on Tiptap, a popular
editor for the web, and Yjs, a real-time collaboration framework that
enables users to collaborate on shared documents simultaneously.

To run the Toygrid server, you can use the following command: 
``` 
cd server && go run . ~/lab/cswg/toygrid/public 
```

The collaborative editor can be set up using various components and
configurations, such as Collaboration and CollaborationCursor. The
WebSocket URL and Yjs WebSocket Server URL are used to establish the
connection for real-time collaboration.

Toygrid's codebase includes React frontend components, styles, and
scripts for the collaborative editor, deployment, and more. The
documentation provides examples of various commands, configurations,
and links for learning more about different features and advanced
configurations.

what is yjs?

Yjs is a real-time collaboration framework that allows users to work
together on shared documents simultaneously. It is designed for
peer-to-peer collaborative editing and supports various data
synchronization protocols, data models, and data structures. Yjs
enables developers to build collaborative applications such as text
editors, spreadsheets, and design tools while providing conflict
resolution and offline editing capabilities. It can be used with
various frontend libraries like Tiptap, Quill, and ACE, and can be
integrated with different communication protocols like WebSockets and
WebRTC.

can yjs be used without a central server?

Yes, Yjs can be used without a central server. It is designed to
support peer-to-peer (P2P) collaboration, allowing users to work
together on shared documents directly. In P2P mode, data is
synchronized between users without a central server by using WebRTC or
other P2P communication protocols.

However, using a central server, like the y-websocket server, can
provide additional benefits such as handling more connections,
ensuring data persistence, and better supporting users behind
restrictive firewalls. But if your use case doesn't require these
benefits, you can use Yjs in a purely P2P manner.

does Yjs support protocol plugins?

Yes, Yjs supports protocol plugins. It is designed to be highly
extensible and allows developers to integrate different communication
protocols for data synchronization. Common protocols include
WebSockets and WebRTC, but you can also implement custom protocols to
suit your application's specific needs. This flexibility makes Yjs
adaptable to various use cases and network conditions.

how do i rsync to a server when ssh is running on a high-numbered port?

To use `rsync` when the SSH server is running on a high-numbered port,
you can specify the port using the `-e` option followed by the `ssh -p
[port_number]` command. The syntax for the `rsync` command would be:

```bash
rsync -avz -e 'ssh -p [port_number]' [source] [user]@[server]:[destination]
```

Replace `[port_number]` with the high-numbered port on which the SSH
server is running. Replace `[source]` with the local file or directory
you want to transfer, `[user]` with your remote server's username,
`[server]` with the remote server's address or hostname, and
`[destination]` with the path on the remote server where you want to
transfer the files.

For example, if the SSH server is running on port 2222, and you want
to transfer a local directory named `my_directory` to the user `john`
on the server `example.com` into the `/home/john/destination_folder`
directory, the command would look like this:

```bash
rsync -avz -e 'ssh -p 2222' my_directory john@example.com:/home/john/destination_folder/
```

from inside Go WASM code, how do i get the server URL, hostname,
and/or port?

In your current context, you seem to be using JavaScript in
conjunction with Go WebAssembly to run a webpage with a WebSocket
connection. To get the server URL, hostname, and/or port from inside
the Go WebAssembly (WASM) code, you can access the window object
properties using the `syscall/js` package. You can pass the required
information from JavaScript to Go WASM by creating global JavaScript
variables and accessing them from Go.

Here's a simple example:

1. In your HTML file, set the server information in JavaScript, something like this:

```html
<script>
    var serverInfo = {
        hostname: window.location.hostname,
        port: window.location.port,
        protocol: window.location.protocol
    };
</script>
```

2. In your Go WebAssembly code, use the `syscall/js` package to access
   the information from the global JavaScript variable `serverInfo`:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"syscall/js"
)

func main() {
	window := js.Global()
	serverInfo := window.Get("serverInfo")

	hostname := serverInfo.Get("hostname").String()
	port := serverInfo.Get("port").String()
	protocol := serverInfo.Get("protocol").String()

	fmt.Printf("Hostname: %s, Port: %s, Protocol: %s\n", hostname, port, protocol)
}
```

Now, when you run your Go WebAssembly code in the browser, you'll be
able to access the server URL, hostname, and port from the JavaScript
environment.


from inside Go WASM code, how do i get the entire window.location
structure?

To access the entire `window.location` object from inside Go WASM
code, you can use the `syscall/js` package. Here is an example:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "syscall/js"
)

func main() {
    // Access the window object
    window := js.Global()

    // Access window.location property
    location := window.Get("location")

    // Access the properties of the location object
    href := location.Get("href").String()
    protocol := location.Get("protocol").String()
    host := location.Get("host").String()
    hostname := location.Get("hostname").String()
    port := location.Get("port").String()
    pathname := location.Get("pathname").String()
    search := location.Get("search").String()
    hash := location.Get("hash").String()
   
    fmt.Printf("Href: %s\nProtocol: %s\nHost: %s\nHostname: %s\nPort: %s\nPathname: %s\nSearch: %s\nHash: %s\n",
        href, protocol, host, hostname, port, pathname, search, hash)
}
```

This code demonstrates how to access all the properties of
`window.location` from within Go WebAssembly code. You can then use
these properties as needed in your Go code.

from inside javascript code in the browser, can i force a reload of
the page, for example if any WASM components have been recompiled and
need to be fetched again?

Yes, you can force a reload of the page from within JavaScript code in
the browser. You can use the `location.reload()` method to refresh the
page. If you want to force a hard reload (bypassing the cache), you
can pass `true` as an argument to the `reload()` method:

```javascript
window.location.reload(); // Normal reload
window.location.reload(true); // Hard reload, bypassing the cache
```

You can use this method to reload the page whenever necessary, such as
when the WASM components have been recompiled and need to be fetched
again.


from inside javascript code in the browser, i want to force a reload,
bypassing the cache, if the results of a GET /version have changed.

To achieve this, you can fetch the `/version` endpoint periodically
and compare it with the current version. If the fetched version is
different from the current version, you can force a hard reload to
bypass the cache.

Here's an example using `fetch` and asynchronous function:

```javascript
let currentVersion;

const getVersion = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/version', { cache: 'no-store' });
    if (response.ok) {
      return await response.text();
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching /version:', error);
  }
};

const checkAndUpdateVersion = async () => {
  const fetchedVersion = await getVersion();
  
  if (currentVersion && fetchedVersion !== currentVersion) {
    // Force a hard reload, bypassing the cache
    window.location.reload(true);
  }

  currentVersion = fetchedVersion;
};

// Check for version updates every 30 seconds
setInterval(checkAndUpdateVersion, 30 * 1000);
```

This code will fetch the `/version` endpoint every 30 seconds and
compare with the current version. If the fetched version is different,
a hard reload will be forced, bypassing the cache.


from inside javascript code in the browser, at page load time i want
to compare the results of a "GET /version" with a value i previously
stored in the local hard drive, and if they are different i want to
force a reload bypassing the cache.

To accomplish this, you can use the `fetch` function to get the
`/version` from the server and compare it with the stored version in
the browser's local storage. If they are different, you can force a
hard reload, bypassing the cache. Here's a code example:

```javascript
// Fetch version from the server
const fetchVersion = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/version', { cache: 'no-store' });
    if (response.ok) {
      return await response.text();
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching /version:', error);
  }
};

// Get the stored version from the local storage
const getStoredVersion = () => localStorage.getItem('storedVersion');

// Store the version in local storage
const storeVersion = (version) => localStorage.setItem('storedVersion', version);

// Check version and hard reload if needed
const checkVersionAndReload = async () => {
  const fetchedVersion = await fetchVersion();
  const storedVersion = getStoredVersion();
  
  if (storedVersion && fetchedVersion !== storedVersion) {
    // Force a hard reload, bypassing the cache
    window.location.reload(true);
  } else {
    // Update the stored version
    storeVersion(fetchedVersion);
  }
};

// On page load, check version and reload if necessary
window.addEventListener('load', checkVersionAndReload);
```

This code will fetch the `/version` endpoint on page load, compare it
with the stored version in local storage, and force a hard reload if
they are different.




from inside javascript code in the browser, at the beginning of page
load i want to compare the results of a "GET /version" with a value 
previously stored locally, and if they are different i want to force a
reload bypassing the cache.

You can use the `fetch` function to make a GET request to `/version`
and compare the result with a locally stored value. If they are
different, you can force a hard reload that bypasses the cache. Here's
a code example:

```javascript
// Fetch version from the server
const fetchVersion = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/version', { cache: 'no-store' });
    if (response.ok) {
      return await response.text();
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching /version:', error);
  }
};

// Get the stored version from the local storage
const getStoredVersion = () => localStorage.getItem('storedVersion');

// Store the version in local storage
const storeVersion = (version) => localStorage.setItem('storedVersion', version);

// Check version and hard reload if needed
const checkVersionAndReload = async () => {
  const fetchedVersion = await fetchVersion();
  const storedVersion = getStoredVersion();
  
  if (storedVersion && fetchedVersion !== storedVersion) {
    // Force a hard reload, bypassing the cache
    window.location.reload(true);
  } else {
    // Update the stored version
    storeVersion(fetchedVersion);
  }
};

// On page load, check version and reload if necessary
window.addEventListener('load', checkVersionAndReload);
```

This code will fetch the `/version` endpoint on page load, compare it
with the stored version in local storage, and force a hard reload if
they are different.

i don't see where this code stores the new version in the case of a
hard reload.  is that a bug?

You are correct, the code does not store the new fetched version
before performing the hard reload. This can lead to a situation where
the fetched version is never stored. To fix that, modify the
`checkVersionAndReload` function as follows:

```javascript
// Check version and hard reload if needed
const checkVersionAndReload = async () => {
  const fetchedVersion = await fetchVersion();
  const storedVersion = getStoredVersion();
  
  if (storedVersion && fetchedVersion !== storedVersion) {
    // Update the stored version before the hard reload
    storeVersion(fetchedVersion);

    // Force a hard reload, bypassing the cache
    window.location.reload(true);
  } else if (!storedVersion) {
    // If no stored version exists, store the fetched version
    storeVersion(fetchedVersion);
  }
};

// On page load, check version and reload if necessary
window.addEventListener('load', checkVersionAndReload);
```

This updated code will store the fetched version before performing the
hard reload, ensuring that the newly fetched version is stored
correctly.

I've put that version reload code in public/ckversion.js, and I want
to refer to it in a <script> tag in index.html.  if i want the
ckversion code to run at the beginning of page load before any other
code, should i put the <script> tag in <head> or <body>, and at the
bottom or top?

To run the ckversion.js code at the beginning of the page load before
any other code, you should place the `<script>` tag in the `<head>`
section of your index.html file, preferably at the top. This will
ensure that it loads and executes before any other scripts on the
page. Your index.html file would look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <!-- your other meta tags go here -->
   
    <!-- Add the ckversion.js script at the top of the head -->
    <script src="ckversion.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your page content and other script tags go here -->
  </body>
</html>
```


i want to visually separate the microfrontends in index.html.  should
i do that with tables, or with css?

It is recommended to use CSS to visually separate the microfrontends
in index.html. Using tables for layout purposes is outdated and not
considered a good practice. CSS provides more flexible and responsive
design options, which makes it easier to maintain and adapt your
layout for different devices and screen sizes. You can use CSS grid or
flexbox for creating layouts and visually separating the
microfrontends.

show me an example.

Certainly! Here's an example using CSS Flexbox to create a layout that visually separates the microfrontends:

First, add some sample microfrontends to your `index.html`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  <title>Microfrontends Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="microfrontend-1">Microfrontend 1</div>
    <div class="microfrontend-2">Microfrontend 2</div>
    <div class="microfrontend-3">Microfrontend 3</div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Now, create a `styles.css` file for the layout styling:

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  padding: 16px;
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

/* Style for each microfrontend */
.microfrontend-1,
.microfrontend-2,
.microfrontend-3 {
  background-color: lightgrey;
  padding: 16px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  /* Width of each microfrontend divided equally */
  width: calc((100% - 32px) / 3);
  /* Replace height with your desired height */
  height: 300px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

In this example, we use Flexbox in the `.container` class to create a
responsive and flexible layout. The `.microfrontend-1`,
`.microfrontend-2`, and `.microfrontend-3` classes represent each
separate microfrontend component within the container. We use
`background-color`, `padding`, `border-radius`, and other styles to
visually separate them for a nice-looking layout.

can you show me the same example using div id instead of class?

Of course! Here's the same example using `div` ids instead of classes:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  <title>Microfrontends Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="container">
    <div id="microfrontend-1">Microfrontend 1</div>
    <div id="microfrontend-2">Microfrontend 2</div>
    <div id="microfrontend-3">Microfrontend 3</div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

And the corresponding CSS using ids:

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

/* Style for each microfrontend */
#microfrontend-1,
#microfrontend-2,
#microfrontend-3 {
  background-color: lightgrey;
  padding: 16px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  /* Width of each microfrontend divided equally */
  width: calc((100% - 32px) / 3);
  /* Replace height with your desired height */
  height: 300px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  font-size: 24px;
}

/* Container styles */
#container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  padding: 16px;
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

This version of the example uses `id` attributes instead of `class`
attributes, and the CSS selectors are updated accordingly to target
the ids (`#` instead of `.`).


toygrid includes the tiptap editor as a microfrontend.  but the tiptap
button images aren't showing in the browser. why not?

The issue with the Tiptap button images not showing in the browser
might be due to a missing or incorrect reference to the icon font or
style files in your project. 

Please follow these steps to make sure the icons are displayed
properly:

1. Ensure you have the necessary font files, such as "remixicon.ttf,"
   or icon library in your project. If you're using a package like
   "remixicon," install it by running `npm install remixicon`

how can i tell if remixicon has already been installed?

You can check if `remixicon` has already been installed in your
project by looking for it in the `package.json` file, under the
`dependencies` or `devDependencies` sections.

2. Import the CSS file, SVG file (if necessary), or the font file in
   your main JS or CSS file. For example, if you're using Remix Icon:

```javascript
import 'remixicon/fonts/remixicon.css';
```

3. Include a reference to the font files in your CSS file, specifying
   the correct path according to your project structure:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'remixicon';
  src: url('/path/to/remixicon.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

4. Make sure your CSS file includes styles for the Tiptap toolbar buttons with the appropriate icon classes:

```css
.tiptap-extension-toolbar__button {
  font-family: 'remixicon';
  /* ... other styles */
}

.tiptap-extension-toolbar__button-name::before {
  content: attr(data-icon);
  margin-right: 4px;
}
```

5. Check that the Tiptap toolbar buttons have the correct `data-icon` attribute set to display the icon. For example:

```html
<button class="tiptap-extension-toolbar__button" data-icon="&#xe6b9;">Bold</button>
```

By following these steps, you should be able to see the Tiptap button images in the browser. If you still encounter issues, please check your browser's developer console for error messages or network issues related to loading the font files.



I see remixicon in package.json.  It's still not working.

If you see `remixicon` in the `package.json` file but the icons are
still not working, please follow these steps to ensure it is set up
correctly:

1. Confirm that `remixicon` has been installed by running `npm install
   remixicon` or checking the `node_modules` folder for the
   `remixicon` directory.

2. Import the `remixicon` CSS file in your main JS or CSS file, like this:

   ```javascript
   import 'remixicon/fonts/remixicon.css';
   ```

3. Check your CSS file to make sure the icon font is properly referenced. For instance:

   ```css
   @font-face {
     font-family: 'remixicon';
     src: url('./node_modules/remixicon/fonts/remixicon.ttf') format('truetype');
     font-weight: normal;
     font-style: normal;
   }
   ```

4. Ensure your HTML or component code includes the appropriate icon classes. For example:

   ```html
   <i class="ri-home-fill"></i>
   ```

5. Make sure there are no errors in the browser console related to
   loading the font files. If you see any issues, double-check the
   file paths and your setup.

After following these steps, the Remix Icon should work correctly in
your project. If the issue persists, please let me know so I can
provide further assistance.

where is the main css file?

The main CSS file for the layout is "styles.css". It is referenced in
the index.html file as follows:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```

Additionally, for the Tiptap editor, the main CSS file seems to be
"styles.scss" located in the `editor/src` directory and imported in
the App.jsx file:

```javascript
import './styles.scss'
```


is the icon font properly referenced in either styles.css or
styles.scss?

Based on the provided context, it seems that the icon font is
correctly referenced in the `styles.scss` file inside the `editor/src`
directory. The `@font-face` rule is set up as follows:

```scss
@font-face {
  font-family: 'remixicon';
  src: url('./node_modules/remixicon/fonts/remixicon.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

The `styles.scss` file is then imported in the `App.jsx` file with the
following line:

```javascript
import './styles.scss';
```

However, please ensure that the correct file path is provided to the
`src` attribute in the `@font-face` rule according to your project
structure.


how can i tell if remixicon.ttf isn't being found at either build time
or runtime?



To check if the remixicon.ttf isn't being found at build time or
runtime, follow these steps:

1. Build-time errors: Ensure that the file path provided in the
   `@font-face` rule (in your CSS or SCSS file) is correct according
   to your project's structure. If the path is incorrect, the build
   process may show an error or a warning.

2. Runtime errors: Open your browser's developer console and check the
   "Network" tab for any error messages or failed requests related to
   remixicon.ttf. If the font file is not found during runtime, you'll
   see a "404 Not Found" error or similar in the console.

this Makefile stanza, but isn't.  suggest a fix, including a more idiomatic way of
writing this stanza:
```
public/editor/main.js public/style.css: $(tiptap_srcs)                                                           
    # set REACT_APP_YJS_WEBSOCKET_SERVER_URL in local/env                                                       
    cd editor && npm install                                                                                     
    . local/env && cd editor && npm run build                                                                  
    cp editor/build/static/js/main.*.js public/editor/main.js                                                                                                                  
    cp editor/build/static/css/main.*.css public/style.css

To fix the issue with the `remixicon.symbol.svg` path, you should copy
the `static/media` folder to the public folder in your Makefile
stanza. Here's an improved and more idiomatic version of the stanza:

```Makefile

    cp public/editor/static/js/main.*.js public/editor/main.js
    cp public/editor/static/css/main.*.css public/style.css
```

This version of the stanza ensures that the entire static directory,
including the `media` folder containing the `remixicon.symbol.svg`, is
copied to the public folder.

why not just do this?
```Makefile
public/editor/main.js public/style.css: $(tiptap_srcs)
    # set REACT_APP_YJS_WEBSOCKET_SERVER_URL in local/env
    cd editor && npm install
    . local/env && cd editor && npm run build
    mkdir -p public/editor/static
    cp -r editor/build/static/* public/editor/static/
```

You're right! The simplified version you provided is more efficient
and still properly handles the `remixicon.symbol.svg` issue. The
previous version was copying each subfolder individually and then
copying the main.js and style.css files. Your suggested workaround
copies the entire `static` directory and its contents in one step,
which is cleaner and more straightforward. Here's your suggested
stanza:

```Makefile
public/editor/main.js public/style.css: $(tiptap_srcs)
    # set REACT_APP_YJS_WEBSOCKET_SERVER_URL in local/env
    cd editor && npm install
    . local/env && cd editor && npm run build
    mkdir -p public/editor/static
    cp -r editor/build/static/* public/editor/static/
```

This Makefile stanza should resolve the issue with the
`remixicon.symbol.svg` path and is a more idiomatic solution.




what is rfc 8445 ICE?

XXX

RFC 8445 is the specification for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE). ICE is a network protocol used to establish peer-to-peer media communication sessions, such as voice, video, and data communication, in network environments where Network Address Translation (NAT) and firewalls are present. 

ICE helps to overcome the obstacles posed by NATs and firewalls by discovering multiple potential communication paths between peers and selecting the optimal path for media transmission. It achieves this by using various mechanisms, including STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) and TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT), to detect and test different connectivity possibilities.

The goal of ICE is to provide reliable, efficient, and secure connectivity in complex network topologies, enhancing the performance and success rate of communication sessions in applications like VoIP, video conferencing, and real-time data sharing.

XXX tahoe-lafs architecture has a lot of good ideas to borrow from 
- https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/tahoe-lafs
- https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/tahoe-lafs/blob/master/docs/architecture.rst#file-encoding
- https://blog.torproject.org/tor-heart-tahoe-lafs/
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahoe-LAFS

describe some of the ideas from tahoe-lafs that may be applicable to
pup, pupgrid, or toygrid.

XXX Tahoe-LAFS is a secure, distributed, and fault-tolerant storage system
that can potentially provide some ideas for pup, pupgrid, or toygrid.
Here are a few concepts that may be applicable:

1. File encoding: Tahoe-LAFS uses erasure coding to encode files, which provides redundancy and ensures data availability even in the case of failures or node unavailability. This technique could be potentially used in pup, pupgrid, or toygrid to improve data resilience.

2. Decentralized architecture: Tahoe-LAFS relies on a decentralized architecture, which can help achieve better privacy, security, and resilience. pup, pupgrid, or toygrid may use a similar decentralized approach to enhance these aspects.

3. Capability-based access control: Tahoe-LAFS employs capability-based access control to manage permissions for reading, writing, or modifying files. This method could be useful for implementing secure access control in pup, pupgrid, or toygrid applications.

4. Cryptographic techniques: Tahoe-LAFS uses public-key cryptography to ensure data is securely encrypted and transmitted between nodes. Incorporating cryptographic techniques in pup, pupgrid, or toygrid could help protect user data, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

5. Peer-to-peer file sharing: Tahoe-LAFS enables file sharing in a P2P manner, which facilitates data distribution and availability. A similar approach can be adopted for pup, pupgrid, or toygrid, enabling efficient data sharing and synchronization between peers.

6. Scalability: Tahoe-LAFS can scale horizontally, as it can handle an increased number of nodes while maintaining performance. Applying similar concepts to pup, pupgrid, or toygrid can help build systems that grow with user demand.

By analyzing and leveraging these ideas from Tahoe-LAFS, it's possible to incorporate valuable design concepts into pup, pupgrid, or toygrid projects.



when using this CSS with index.html, i'm not getting the visible
border lines around the microfrontends that i want:
```css
/* Style for each microfrontend */
#javascript,
#go,
#db,
#websocket {
  background-color: lightgrey;
  padding: 16px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  /* Width of each microfrontend divided equally */
  width: calc((100% - 32px) / 3);
  /* Replace height with your desired height */
  height: 300px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  font-size: 24px;
}

/* Container styles */
#container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  padding: 16px;
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

You mentioned that you are not getting the visible border lines around
the microfrontends. Based on the provided CSS, it seems that you have
missed adding the border property to your microfrontend styling. To
add border lines around the microfrontends, you need to add a lines of
code like `border: 1px solid #000;` (you can adjust the color and the
width of the border as per your preference) inside the #javascript,
#go, #db, #websocket {} ruleset. Here's the updated CSS:

```css
/* Style for each microfrontend */
#javascript,
#go,
#db,
#websocket {
  background-color: lightgrey;
  padding: 16px;
  border: 1px solid #000;
  border-radius: 8px;
  /* Width of each microfrontend divided equally */
  width: calc((100% - 32px) / 3);
  /* Replace height with your desired height */
  height: 300px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  font-size: 24px;
}

/* Container styles */
#container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  padding: 16px;
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

This should give you the visible border lines around the microfrontends that you want.

the 'db' div in public/index.html is rendered with text, followed by
some button and field widgets.  but the buttons and field are showing
up to the right of the text instead of below it. why?  is it something
wrong in styles.css?

The reason the buttons and field widgets are showing up to the right
of the text instead of below it is likely due to the use of `display:
flex;` in your CSS styles for the 'db' div. By default, the
`flex-direction` property is set to `row`, which causes flex items to
align horizontally. To make the buttons and field appear below the
text, you can adjust the `flex-direction` property in your styles.css
for the 'db' div:

```css
#db {
  ...
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  ...
}
```

Adding `flex-direction: column;` will make the elements inside the 'db' div stack vertically, so the buttons and field will appear below the text.
